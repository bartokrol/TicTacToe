# TicTacToe - Game in Vanilla JS

This is a TicTacToe game made to train my programming skills, written in Vanilla JS.

### Start

When DOM is loaded the player has to choose his mark. After this the game begins.
At this stage the player can't slide the page.

### Game

After every click on the empty box on the board the active player changes.
When the game is finished, the boxes that match the winning combinations change their color which shows the exact winning combination.
After this the new game can be started (the players' marks stay the same and the results are still being counted) or the whole page can be reset and the game starts from the beginning.

The current results are counted from the beginning and the players' winning scores increase after each win.
The latest results are also counted from the beginning and can contain last 5 games.
