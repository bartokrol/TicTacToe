# TicTacToe - Game in Vanilla JS

This is TicTacToe game made to train my programming skills written in Vanilla JS.

### Start

When DOM is loaded player has to choose his playing mark. After this the game is started.
In this stage player can't slide the page.

### Game

After every click on the empty box on the board the active player is changing.
When game is finished, the boxes that matches the winning combinations changes color which shows exact winning combination.
After this the new game can be started (tha players mark stays the same and results are being still counted) or the whole page can be reset and the game starts from the beginning.

The current results is counting from the beginning, and the players winning numbers are increasing after each win.
The latest results is also counting from the beginning and can contain last 5 games.
